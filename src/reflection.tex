\section{Comparison of mocking frameworks}
\label{application:comparison}

Compare MoCaml, manual mocking with Kaputt, and JMock. Demonstrate
pros and cons of each framework.

\subsection{Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item JMock can't tell at run-time whether an expecation
  type-checks. Make sure that we can do this!
\item \code{oneOf(mock).foo(); oneOf(mock).foo()} means \textbf{two}
  calls to \code{foo()}, not just one. (Note: this is okay because
  they occur in sequence. Two allowings with this behaviour would be a
  problem.)
\item JMock doesn't allow one to pass in methods or closures to
  implement mock functions, but we can (and should!) allow this.
\end{enumerate}
