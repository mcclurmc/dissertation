  Object mocking is a technique to assist programmers in writing unit
  tests, by replacing hard-to-test dependencies with ``mock''
  implementations of those dependencies. A mock object allows the
  developer to set certain expectations about how the system under
  test will interact with the dependency, and then verify that these
  expectations hold true at the end of the test. While this technique
  was developed as a test design pattern for object oriented
  languages, it can also be useful for functional programming
  languages, especially for applications in which hard-to-test side
  effects can't easily be factored out of pure functions. This
  dissertation will explore the current state of the art tools and
  techniques for unit testing and mock object generation in object
  oriented languages. It will make the case that these techniques can
  be of use in functional programming languages, and it will describe
  the implementation and use of a new mocking library for the OCaml
  programming language.
